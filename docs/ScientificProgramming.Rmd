This Rmarkdown show how to cite:

# How to cite in Rmarkdown?

Items can be cited directly within the documentation using the syntax \@key where key is the citation key in the first line of the entry, e.g., \@R-base. To put citations in parentheses, use [\@key]. To cite multiple entries, separate the keys by semicolons, e.g., [\@key-1; \@key-2; \@key-3]. To suppress the mention of the author, add a minus sign before @, e.g., [-\@R-base].

\nbsp

Example: 

[\@zuur_protocol_2010] --> This is how you should write on Rmarkdown

\nbsp

[\@tukey_exploratory_1977] --> This is how you should write on Rmarkdown


This is how it will actually looks. 

[@zuur_protocol_2010] 

\nbsp

[@tukey_exploratory_1977]

# How can I change the citation style?

By default, Pandoc will use a Chicago author-date format for citations and references. To use another style, you will need to specify a CSL (Citation Style Language) file in the csl metadata field, e.g.

Example: citation.csl in the YAML header. 

# What if I want to add an item to a bibliography without using it?

By default, the bibliography will only display items that are directly referenced in the document. If you want to include items in the bibliography without actually citing them in the body text, you can define a dummy nocite metadata field and put the citations there.

If we do not wish to explicitly state all of the items within the bibliography but would still like to show them in our references, we can use the following syntax:

This will force all items to be displayed in the bibliography.

This is how you should write it:

# Source a script vs. witting the script in the chunks

\nbsp

You can have source ("R/script.R") inside the chunk to not copy all the script. Once you source you script, the script will be performed and the oputput will be display. 

I will create a simple script that plot a vector 1:10

\nbsp

Example:

```{r}
source("../R/0_simpleScript.R")
```


# Just importing the images

A better option is to only load the final results (images)

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "../output/png/Flavonoids-nodGenes-NodFActorsSignaling.png")
```
